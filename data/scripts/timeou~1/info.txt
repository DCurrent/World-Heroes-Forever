So does that mean your problem is solved? :)

 Anyways, I made simple ondeathscript to solve time out problem. It's attached below.
 Put it in data/scripts/ folder.
 To use this simply declare this text:

ondeathscript data/scripts/release.c

 With this, you could omit that function in FALL animation cause this ondeathscript does it better.
